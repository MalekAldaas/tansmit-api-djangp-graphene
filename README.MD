# Transportation System API

A GraphQL API backend for a Transportation System supporting multiple user roles and intercity travel management. Built with Django and Graphene.

---

## Project Overview

This project is designed to handle transportation logistics across multiple cities/countries with different user roles:

- **Customer**: Books and tracks trips.
- **Driver**: Manages driving schedules and routes.
- **Crew**: Supports on-trip operations.
- **Organizer**: Coordinates schedules and vehicle assignments.
- **Manager**: Administers the overall system, roles, and reporting.

The system uses GraphQL to enable flexible and efficient querying and mutations, built on top of Django.

## Features

- User registration and authentication with role-based access control.
- Manage trips, routes, and vehicles.
- Bookings and ticket management.
- Role-specific permissions and operations.
- Intercity transportation support.
- CRUD operations exposed via GraphQL API.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Django 4.x
- Graphene-Django (GraphQL for Django)
- PostgreSQL (recommended)
- Docker (optional for containerization)
